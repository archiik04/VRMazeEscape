# VRMazeEscape ðŸŒ€

**VRMazeEscape** is a first-person virtual reality maze game made with Unity. You explore a glowing digital maze, avoid patrolling enemies, and try to find your way out â€” all from within a fully immersive VR environment.



## About the Game

You wake up in a mysterious neon maze.  There are no clear instructions â€” only paths, lights, arrows, and moving threats. Use your instincts, your minimap, and your eyes to escape before it's too late. Enemies move on fixed patrol routes. If they spot you, it's game over.  
Directional arrows may help... or lead you into trouble. Stay alert!Designed for Meta Quest and XR-compatible headsets.
